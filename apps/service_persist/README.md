# Persist

Service for loading data into storage. Think of this as the `L` in `ETL`.

## Release

Run `mix release persist` to build an Erlang release for this service.

## Docker

The latest release is baked into the `inhindsight/hindsight:latest` Docker image
and is started with a `persist/bin/persist start` command.
