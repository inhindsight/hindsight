# Definition

Definition is a core library for defining complex data types
throughout Hindsight as Elixir structs, validating their contents,
and managing their behavior and functionality throughout the life
of the system as requirements change.

```
    Definition
        |_ Data
        |_ Dataset
        |_ Dataset.Owner
        |_ Dictionary.Type.Integer
        |_ Dictionary.Type.List
        |_ Dictionary.Type.Map
        |_ Dictionary.Type.String
        |_ Dictionary.Type.Date
        |_ Dictionary.Type.Timestamp
        |_ Extract
        |_ Load.Broadcast
        |_ Load.Persist
        |_ Schedule
        |_ Transform
```

The primary module defines a `__using__/1` macro that accepts a
schema definition for the definition type being implemented and
implements functions for creating new instances of the definition
struct from maps, keyword lists, or JSON-formatted strings.

The basic default functions include a pre-compile `migrate/1` function
for defining a migration path to upgrade the specification of the
definition as its needs change and a getter function for
returning the schema definition of the struct instance.

Finally, definition provides an overridable `on_new/1` function that allows
you to define customizable behavior for struct instances to perform
arbitrary operations on instances and their internal data upon creation.

Definition relies on the [Norm](https://hexdocs.pm/norm/Norm.html) validation
library for conforming struct instances to their desired specifications.

## Usage

Below is a simple implementation of Foo type that contains three fields.
On first creation of a new instance of Foo, if not nil, the data in the
`baz` field is converted to an upper-case string. The schema of the current
version of Foo is passed to the `use Definition` macro via the `:schema` argument
which must return a Norm-compatible schema struct.

Foo also includes a legacy definition of its original version 1 specification
in which the data in the `bar` field is required to be a binary, and the current
definition of its version 2 specification updating the data in `bar` to be an integer.

The current version of Foo's `migrate/1` function performs the necessary upgrade of
the Foo schema when `new/1` is called by checking if the instance being created is
of the older "version: 1" type and automatically converts the data in the `:bar` field
from a binary to an integer.

```elixir
defmodule Foo do
  use Definition, schema: Foo.V2
  defstruct [:version, :bar, :baz]

  def on_new(foo) do
    new_baz =
      case foo.baz do
        nil -> nil
        x -> String.upcase(x)
      end

    %{foo | baz: new_baz}
  end

  def migrate(%__MODULE__{version: 1} = old) do
    struct(__MODULE__, %{version: 2, bar: String.to_integer(old.bar)})
  end

  defmodule V1 do
    use Definition.Schema

    def s do
      schema(%Foo{version: spec(fn v -> v == 1 end), bar: spec(is_binary())})
    end
  end

  defmodule V2 do
    use Definition.Schema

    def s do
      schema(%Foo{version: spec(fn v -> v == 2 end), bar: spec(is_integer())})
    end
  end
end

```

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:definition, in_umbrella: true}
  ]
end
```
