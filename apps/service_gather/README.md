# Gather

Service for extracting data from sources. Think of this service as the `E` in `ETL`.

## Release

Run `mix release gather` to build an Erlang release for this service.

## Docker

The latest release is baked into the `inhindsight/hindsight:latest` Docker image
and is started with a `gather/bin/gather start` command.
