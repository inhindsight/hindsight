import Config
#
# Both compilation and runtime configuration should be set here across all apps.
# Non-prod specific environment configuration should reside in an app's config
# file for that Mix environment. For example: apps/my_app/config/test.exs.
#
# Configuration accessing environment variables should ALWAYS set a default,
# as this configuration will ALWAYS be evaluated.
#
# Example:
#
#     config :my_app, :some_key,
#       abc: 123,
#       foo: System.get_env("FOO", "bar:baz")
#
